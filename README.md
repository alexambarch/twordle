# Rest in peace to the Twitter API
This project will no longer do anything due to the fact that the Twitter API is now a paid service. 

# How did it work?
It pulled up to 10k tweets since the most recent Wordle drop using the query "wordle",
filtered the words in those tweets down to the 5 letter words in the Wordle
dictionary, then returned the one that occurred the most frequently. 

# Did it actually solve the Wordle?
No. 

People are pretty good about not spoiling it for others, meaning
that we mostly got words like "there" and "today" out of these tweets. Maybe if
there's a frustrating enough puzzle in the future, Twitter will get angry and
inadvertently cause this to work.
